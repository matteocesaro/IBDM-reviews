# IBDM-reviews
rev-ibdm

We worked on an image recognition task in order to identify bird species using the dataset 'CUB-200-2011.html', which includes 200 categories of bird species and 11,788 images.
The main purpose of this study is to analyze the reviews on IBDM
The approaches used for this analysis are:


Classification: the algorithm's aim is to capture the difference between positive and negative reviews on IBDM and to predict them with an higher accuracy.
Clustering: this method sorts the documents into different groups based on different rules.
I worked on a content based image retrieval task using a dataset which includes 202,941 images of celebrity and famous people [thumbnails-features-deduped-publish]. 
The main purpose of this task is to match a query image with the most similar image on dataset. 
I trained a deep learning model using the #convolutionalneuralnetwork and a specific transfer learning method called #finetuning. 
Subsequently, I trained a #KDTree model aiming to analyze and understand the list of images with most similarity to the given query image.
